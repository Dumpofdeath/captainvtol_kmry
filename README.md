KMRY Monterey Regional Airport for MSFS

Created by: CaptainVTOL

KMRY Monterey Regional Airport is a regional airport located in Monterey, California. The aiport is serviced by Allegiant Air, American Eagle, and United Express, as well as Alask Airlines in 2021. 

The AI-generated KMRY had several issues, such as missing buildings, mountainous taxiways, and a general lack of life. As such, I decided to make my own take on it for use in MSFS.

This airport is free to use and always will be, no matter what additional edits I make. If you use this airport in a stream or other creative media, all I ask is to receive credit for the airport.

Current version: v1.0
